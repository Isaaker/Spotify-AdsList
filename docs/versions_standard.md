## About

The Standard format is a highly compatible format. Although this format may not adapt perfectly to the syntax of your adblocker, you can use it with your adblocker while creating a version more adapted to your adblocker.

In addition, it is possible to use it with the hosts file of your device as described in [this blog](https://nordvpn.com/es/blog/use-hosts-file-block-ads-malware/).
